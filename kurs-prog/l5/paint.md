Creating a Paint-like application in JavaFX is a great project! Here's a breakdown of how you can approach it, focusing on the core components and functionalities:

**1. Core Drawing Area: `Canvas`**

*   The heart of your application will be a `javafx.scene.canvas.Canvas` node.
*   The `Canvas` provides a `GraphicsContext` (`canvas.getGraphicsContext2D()`) which you'll use to perform all drawing operations (drawing lines, shapes, text, images).

**2. Basic UI Structure (Layout)**

*   Use layout panes like `BorderPane`, `VBox`, `HBox`, and `ToolBar` to organize your UI.
*   **Example Structure:**
    *   `BorderPane` (root):
        *   **Top:** `ToolBar` or `HBox` for tool selection, color picker, stroke size.
        *   **Center:** The `Canvas` for drawing.
        *   **Left/Right (Optional):** Panels for layers, more advanced tool options.
        *   **Bottom (Optional):** Status bar for coordinates, zoom level.

**3. Drawing Tools & Functionality**

*   **Tool Selection:**
    *   Use `ToggleButton`s (grouped in a `ToggleGroup`) for selecting tools like Pencil, Eraser, Line, Rectangle, Oval, etc. This ensures only one tool is active at a time.
*   **Color Selection:**
    *   Use `javafx.scene.control.ColorPicker` to allow users to choose drawing colors.
*   **Stroke/Brush Size:**
    *   Use a `javafx.scene.control.Slider` or `ComboBox` to let users select the thickness of lines or brush strokes.
*   **Pencil/Brush Tool:**
    *   **Mouse Events:**
        *   `canvas.setOnMousePressed()`: Get the starting point. Set the `GraphicsContext`'s stroke color and line width. Begin a path (`gc.beginPath()`, `gc.moveTo(x, y)`).
        *   `canvas.setOnMouseDragged()`: Get the current point. Draw a line segment from the previous point to the current point (`gc.lineTo(x, y)`, `gc.stroke()`). Update the previous point.
        *   `canvas.setOnMouseReleased()`: Finalize the path (optional, `gc.closePath()` if needed, but `stroke()` already draws).
*   **Eraser Tool:**
    *   Similar to the pencil, but instead of drawing with the selected color, you draw with the background color of the canvas (e.g., white) or use `gc.clearRect(x, y, width, height)` to clear small rectangles along the mouse path.
*   **Shape Tools (Line, Rectangle, Oval):**
    *   `canvas.setOnMousePressed()`: Store the starting coordinates (e.g., `startX`, `startY`).
    *   `canvas.setOnMouseDragged()`:
        *   This is tricky for live preview. One common approach is to draw on a *temporary* transparent canvas layered on top, or to clear and redraw the shape from `startX, startY` to the current mouse position (`currentX, currentY`) on the main canvas. For simplicity, you might initially only draw the final shape on mouse release.
        *   Calculate width and height: `Math.abs(currentX - startX)`, `Math.abs(currentY - startY)`.
        *   Determine the correct top-left corner for drawing: `Math.min(startX, currentX)`, `Math.min(startY, currentY)`.
    *   `canvas.setOnMouseReleased()`: Get the final end coordinates. Draw the definitive shape on the main canvas using `gc.strokeLine()`, `gc.strokeRect()`, `gc.strokeOval()`, or their `fill` counterparts (`gc.fillRect()`, etc.).
*   **Fill Tool (Bucket - More Advanced):**
    *   Requires a flood fill algorithm. You'd get the color of the pixel clicked and then recursively (or iteratively with a stack/queue) change the color of adjacent pixels of the same color to the new fill color. This operates on the pixel data of the canvas, which can be accessed via a `WritableImage` snapshot.

**4. Handling State**

You'll need member variables in your `Application` class (or a dedicated controller class) to keep track of:

*   The currently selected tool.
*   The currently selected color (from `ColorPicker`).
*   The current stroke width (from `Slider`).
*   Start coordinates for drawing shapes.

**5. `GraphicsContext` Methods**

Key methods you'll use from `GraphicsContext`:

*   `setStroke(Paint p)`: Sets the color for lines/outlines.
*   `setFill(Paint p)`: Sets the color for filling shapes.
*   `setLineWidth(double lw)`: Sets the thickness of lines.
*   `beginPath()`
*   `moveTo(double x, double y)`
*   `lineTo(double x, double y)`
*   `stroke()`: Draws the current path's outline.
*   `fill()`: Fills the current path.
*   `closePath()`
*   `strokeLine(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)`
*   `strokeRect(double x, double y, double w, double h)`
*   `fillRect(double x, double y, double w, double h)`
*   `strokeOval(double x, double y, double w, double h)`
*   `fillOval(double x, double y, double w, double h)`
*   `clearRect(double x, double y, double w, double h)`
*   `fillText(String text, double x, double y)`
*   `strokeText(String text, double x, double y)`
*   `setFont(Font f)`

**Example Snippet (Conceptual for Pencil):**

```java
// Inside your Application class
private Canvas canvas;
private GraphicsContext gc;
private ColorPicker colorPicker;
private Slider strokeSizeSlider;
private ToggleButton pencilToolButton; // Assume this is part of a ToggleGroup

// ... in start() method ...
canvas = new Canvas(800, 600);
gc = canvas.getGraphicsContext2D();
// Initialize colorPicker, strokeSizeSlider, pencilToolButton etc.

// Default drawing settings
gc.setStroke(Color.BLACK);
gc.setLineWidth(1);

colorPicker.setOnAction(e -> gc.setStroke(colorPicker.getValue()));
strokeSizeSlider.valueProperty().addListener((obs, oldVal, newVal) -> gc.setLineWidth(newVal.doubleValue()));

canvas.setOnMousePressed(event -> {
    if (pencilToolButton.isSelected()) { // Check if pencil tool is active
        gc.beginPath();
        gc.moveTo(event.getX(), event.getY());
        gc.stroke(); // Draw a dot at the start
    }
    // ... handle other tools ...
});

canvas.setOnMouseDragged(event -> {
    if (pencilToolButton.isSelected()) {
        gc.lineTo(event.getX(), event.getY());
        gc.stroke();
    }
    // ... handle other tools ...
});

// canvas.setOnMouseReleased for shape tools, etc.
```

**6. Advanced Features (Consider Later)**

*   **File Menu (New, Open, Save):**
    *   **Save:** Take a snapshot of the `Canvas` using `canvas.snapshot(null, null)` to get a `WritableImage`. Then use `javax.imageio.ImageIO.write()` to save it to a file (e.g., PNG). You'll need to add `requires java.desktop;` to your `module-info.java` for `ImageIO`.
    *   **Open:** Load an image using `new Image(inputStream)` and draw it onto the canvas using `gc.drawImage()`.
    *   **New:** Clear the canvas (`gc.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.getWidth(), canvas.getHeight())`).
*   **Undo/Redo:**
    *   This is complex. You might store snapshots of the canvas (`WritableImage`) in a list for undo/redo, or store a list of drawing commands that can be replayed.
*   **Text Tool:** Use `gc.fillText()` or `gc.strokeText()`. You might need a `TextInputDialog` to get the text from the user.
*   **Zooming/Panning:** More complex, involves transforming the `GraphicsContext`.

**Steps to Get Started:**

1.  **Set up the Basic UI:** Create the `Stage`, `Scene`, a `BorderPane`, and add a `Canvas` to its center.
2.  **Add a ColorPicker and Stroke Slider:** Place them in a `ToolBar` or `HBox` at the top.
3.  **Implement the Pencil Tool:** Focus on handling `setOnMousePressed` and `setOnMouseDragged` to draw freehand lines. Make sure color and stroke size changes are reflected.
4.  **Add Tool Selection:** Introduce `ToggleButton`s for different tools.
5.  **Implement Shape Tools:** Start with the Line tool, then Rectangle, then Oval.
6.  **Gradually Add More Features:** Eraser, Save/Open, etc.

This is a significant project, so break it down into smaller, manageable pieces. Start with the core drawing functionality and build from there!

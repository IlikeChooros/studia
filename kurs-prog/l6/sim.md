## Simulation of wolf population dynamics

Simulates wolf hunting on a 2D plane on rabbits

Made in Java, with JavaFX for the GUI, user on startup may
parameterize the simulation by setting:
- the initial number of wolves (default = 1)
- ... rabbits (default = 10)
- cycle parameter (so that the cycle duration is a random number
  between 0.5 * cycle duration and 1.5 * cycle duration)
- size of the plane (n x m)
